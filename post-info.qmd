**Dear Colleagues,**

Thank you once again for your support and contributions to ICBBG 2025! 

We hope you had a rewarding and enjoyable experience.

We're pleased to share some post-conference information that has been requested by many attendees.


## üìñ Proceedings

* Most accepted papers have been assigned DOIs, using the format: `https://doi.org/10.53243/ICBBG2025-xx`, where "ICBBG2025-xx" is the paper ID.
* A **temporary repository** with most accepted papers can be accessed:   
[Google Drive Folder for Proceedings (temporary)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BtVr3GKSSQ3RcUTrydwUQ6LKGDezS42b?usp=drive_link){.btn .btn-primary}.

::: {.callout-tip}
