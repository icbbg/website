[**Snakeskin-inspired surfaces for control of load transfer: conceptualization, characterization, and application**]{.highlight}
 <br/>
**Alejandro Martinez** is an associate professor at the University of California, Davis. He obtained his Ph.D. and M.S. degrees from Georgia Tech in 2015 and 2012, respectively, and his B.S. from the University of Texas at Austin in 2010. His research aims to further the understanding of soil behavior and soil-inclusion interactions involved in geotechnical engineering as well as in burrowing and locomotion. His research interests include soil-structure interaction, bio-inspired geotechnics, fabric effects on soil behavior, and static liquefaction of soils. His research employs a combination of experimental laboratory, hypergravity modeling, and numerical techniques. In 2020, he received the NSF CAREER award and in 2022 he received the ASCE Arthur Casagrande Career Development Award.

![Leon van Paassen<br/> ](img/leon.png)

[**Bio-based ground improvement - from theory to practice and back again**]{.highlight}
 <br/>
**Leon van Paassen** is an expert on Biogeotechnics with more than 20 years of experience in academia and industry. He graduated as an Engineering Geologist at Delft University of Technology in 2002. After his graduation he worked for several years at the Dutch research institute GeoDelft (later Deltares). In 2005 he went back to school and in 2009 he obtained a PhD degree in Environmental Biotechnology from Delft University of Technology. His thesis "Biogrout, Ground Improvement by Microbially Induced Carbonate Precipitation", resulted in several highly cited papers and the prestigious ISSMGE Outstanding Young Geotechnical Engineer Award 2009, which got him a job in academia, first as an Assistant Professor at Delft University of Technology and later in 2017 as Associate Professor and Senior Investigator at the Center for Bio-Mediated and Bio-Inspired Geotechnics at Arizona State University. Here he continued to investigate bio-based ground improvement methods and scaled them up from fundamental concepts to full-scale implementation in the field. Along the way he advised more than 120 PhD, MSc, and BSc students, with whom he has published more than 120 papers in peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings. In 2022, he decided to move back to the Netherlands, where he currently works for Boskalis, a globally operating marine contractor based in The Netherlands. He develops innovative ground improvement and soil characterization methods to solve challenges in large dredging and land reclamation projects. He is still affiliated to Arizona State University and Delft University of Technology, and in 2026, together with international colleagues in Engineering Geology he will host the XV World Congress of the International Association of Engineering Geologist in his hometown Delft.
