Below is a checklist of mandatory and optional formatting requirements.\n\nMandatory Formatting Requirements\n\nMargins: 1-inch on all sides (top, bottom, left, right).\n\nMain Font: Black, Times New Roman, 12 pt.\n\nTitle Position: Two single-spaced blank lines above the title. This is very important!\nFront Matter Formatting:\n\nTitle: Black, bold, single-spaced (if multi-line), with no punctuation at the end.\n\nAuthor Names: Black, bold, with affiliations indicated using superscript numbers. Professional society memberships (e.g., ASCE S.M.) are allowed but not mandatory. Use single spacing if spanning multiple lines.\n\nAuthor Affiliations: Single-spaced.\n\nSpacing: Leave a blank line between each section (title, author names, and affiliations). Single-spaced within each section.\n\n\nHeaders & Footers: No document-level headers or footers. Remove any page numbers.\n\nMetadata Consistency:\n\nThe ICBBG2025-metadata spreadsheet file contains metadata for each paper.\n\nEnsure the title and author list (including order) in the paper match the metadata.\n\nIf discrepancies are found, update the ICBBG2025-metadata spreadsheet accordingly.\n\n\nFirst-Level Headings:\n\nFully capitalized, black, bold.\n\nLeave one blank line before and after each heading.\n\nDo not include numbering.\n\n\nFigure & Table Captions:\n\nSpelled out as “Figure X.” or “Table X.” (with a period).\n\nThe entire caption should be bold only (no italics or special colors).\n\n\nNo Track Changes or Comments:\n\nAll revisions must be accepted.\n\nComments must be deleted.\n\nMain text must be in black font only.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Formatting Elements\nYou do not need to correct the following:\n\nParagraph Indentation: Ignore inconsistencies.\n\nPage Limit: Some papers exceed the 10-page limit. No need to flag this at this point."

Should the letters be upper or lower case? should they be put in parentheses?. Also, should we unify the way figures and tables are referenced in the text? For example, Fig. / Tab. or Figure. / Table. ? How should the numbers and letter be appended (1a, 1(a))?\nA: Let’s not worry too much about the numbering or citation of subfigures—otherwise, it may create too much extra work. As long as the captions are bolded and the identifiers are spelled out (i.e., “Figure X”), and the naming convention for subfigures is consistent within each paper, it’s good to go."

However, if you encounter one of your own papers, your co-editor should handle it.\nFor themes with a large number of papers, please coordinate with your co-editor to distribute the workload effectively. If you need additional co-editors to share the workload, please let us know—and feel free to suggest candidates.\nThere will be a single round of external reviews. If a paper requires revision and resubmission, the editor should review the revised version and make a final decision."
